The city of Ragusa has stood its ground for centuries against the major powers of the world, navigating the eternal and complex whirl of diplomatic alliances and has skillfully avoiding conflict after conflict. With cunning and stubbornness your empire - though modest in size - has bested those far larger in regards to trade, culture and diplomacy. The intelligence and security network launched by your predecessors, strecthing all across the world has so far both kept you safe and fostered prosperity. With your noble devotion to the causes of the Republic, this may be only the beginning.",

After the Florentine Republic fell into hedonism and greed during the so called 'Renaissance', you emerged from humble origins to return the people to proper worship and fear of the Lord. The ostentatious trends of the day were insults and open rebellion against the word of God, and thus you organized magnificent Bonfires of the Vanities to destroy the grotesque onanisms of self-aggrandized artists. Unfortunately, the heathens and hypocrites eventually emerged once more to rebel against your holy retribution and had you burned at the stake, becoming a martyr for the cause of Christ.",

As the last member of the Attonids, you brought the spiritual and political domains of the noble house of Canossa to the greatest of heights, leaving behind the Terre Matildiche, a fabled patrimony which Popes and nobles would fight over in the centuries to come. Throughout your life, you showed your devotion to your faith and the Papacy, culminating in the Investiture Controversy, where you showed your dedication to the Church by giving over your domains to the Pope in defiance of King Henry IV, your cousin, the same king who had stood barefoot in the snow during the Humiliation of Canossa. You were a consistent patron of churches and hospitals, especially those loyal to the Gregorian reforms.",
